This part consistsed of some EDA to understand the frequency with which certain words appear in 'impacful' tweets vs. non-impactful tweets to potentially use the presence of these words in tweets as binary variables.

The second .ipynb file shows some feature engineering with Spacy's Named Entity Recognition, as well as looking at the prevelance of punctuation in the tweets. My source for finding out about Spacy's NER was [here.](https://medium.com/@dobko_m/nlp-text-data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-ea3ffe0406c1)

 1) CARDINAL
